# summary from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_control

change control is a process used to ensure that changes to a product/system are introduced 
in a controlled and coordinated manner.
The goals of a change control procedure usually include
minimal disruption to services, 
reduction in back-out activities,
cost-effective utilization of resources involved in implementing change.



change control can be described as a set of six steps:
1. plan/scope
- consider primary/ancillary details of the proposed change.
2. assess/analyze
-when executed, will the proposed plan cause smth to go wrong?
-Even minor details should be considered during this phase.
-A risk category should be assigned to the proposed change. 
3. review/approval
-The plan/scope and impact/risk assessments are considered in the context of business goals, requirements, and resources
4. build/test
-If the change control request is approved to move forward, will execute the solution through a small-scale dev process 
-Through this, design and make incremental changes with unit and/or regression testing
5. implement
- should implement the change not only according to the approved plan but also according to org. standards and quality management standards.
- Following implementation, the team may also carry out a post-implementation review
6. close
-determine that the project is actually complete
-evaluate "the project plan in the context of project completion"
-provide tangible proof of project success
